# 69. Sqrt(x)

## 문제

Given a non-negative integer x x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

pow(x, 0.5) or x \*\* 0.5.

### Example

1. Input: x = 4  
   Output: 2

2. Input: x = 8  
   Output: 2  
   Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

### 문제 풀이

```js
var mySqrt = function (x) {
  return Math.floor(Math.pow(x, 0.5));
};
```
